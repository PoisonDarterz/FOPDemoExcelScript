1. Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Next, download the student list, which is typically named as "courseid_151_participants.xlsx," and place it in this repository.
3. Download the weekly attendance files for the students, with file names starting with "WIX1002_AttendanceSession_," and organize them into folders using the naming convention "month_year" within this repository. For example, you can create a folder named "October_2023."
