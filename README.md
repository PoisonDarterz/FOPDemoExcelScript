## basic workflow:

### you need to manually:
1. Download student list for your own OCC
2. Download students' each week attendance
These will be in .xlsx

### then you need to
1. check variable names and file names in the .ipynb so the dates are correct (i.e. update them next month)
2. just click "Run All Cells" and all the .csv will generate out. The final product will be final.csv

### then you need to manually again
1. copy the final.csv into the student namelist claim template
